## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rishabh Kochar

ðŸš€ Code Alchemist | Bug Hunter | Coffee-Powered Innovator

I craft iOS apps and full-stack web solutions that run smoother than your morning coffee. Passionate about new tech, frameworks, and solving problems, I love creating seamless user experiencesâ€”because glitches belong in video games, not apps!
I also have experience with Python (data science-related) and C++ (tried my hand at game development).

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools:

Languages: Swift, JavaScipt, C++, Python.
Frameworks/Libraries: UIKit, SwiftUI, React, Node.js, Express.js.
Backend: Firebase, MongoDB.



ðŸ’¡ Always open to collaborations, discussions, and exciting projects!
